    <h1>CS349 Assignment 2</h1>
    <strong><em>Due: Monday, February 9, 2015, 5PM EST</em></strong>

    <div>
        <h2>Assignment Goals</h2>

        <p>
            The goals of this assignment are to give you an opportunity to:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                gain experience with visual design, interface layout, and responsive design,
            </li>
            <li>
                create HTML widgets from scratch,
            </li>
            <li>
                learn and apply the Factory design pattern, and
            </li>
            <li>
                further hone your model, view, controller (MVC) design and implementation skills.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            You will do so in the context of creating an interactive, single-page web app that allows
            users to load images from the file system, rate them, and filter them based on rating.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>

        <h2>Assignment Overview</h2>

        <p>
            In this assignment, you will create a photo rating web application called
            <em>Fotag</em>, which allows users to display a set of images using
            different views. Users can rate each image, and filter images based on their
            ratings. The images will be "loaded" from the file system, and chosen using HTML5's new
            file chooser capabilities. The images chosen, and the ratings, will be stored locally
            using localStorage. We have provided you with code that deals with storing and retrieving
            image collections.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong><em>
                For this assignment, you cannot use any third-party HTML, JavaScript, CSS, or code-generation
                utilities. You must create all HTML, JavaScript, and CSS on your own.
            </em></strong>
        </p>

        <h2>
            Fotag: Interaction Design
        </h2>

        <p>
            Users can view the images in two modes -- grid layout (which arranges the photos in a grid format)
            or list layout (which arranges the photos one after another, along with the metadata for each photo).
            To switch between these two layout modes, users can click a button found in a toolbar that is fixed
            to the top. The two view selection buttons should be image-based <em>toggle</em> buttons: when pressed, a
            button should appear and remain depressed until the other button is pressed.
        </p>

        <p>
            Your application should also be responsive to the user's display. More specifically, it must render
            differently on smaller displays/screens/windows than on larger displays/screens/windows (effectively,
            this means there are two visual designs for your app, one for small sizes, one for large sizes). These
            differences
            should be handled entirely by CSS designed for the two different sizes (the breakpoint is defined below).
            When displayed on a mobile device:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>the grid layout should size to the screen,</li>
            <li>the list layout should show the metadata below, instead of beside, each image, and</li>
            <li>any labels you provide for metadata should appear on lines separate from the metadata itself (for
                example,
                if you have a "File name:" label, it should appear on a line separate from the file name; note that
                there are no labels in any of the wireframes provided, and they're entirely optional).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            In no case, should a horizontal scrollbar appear (for small or large displays).
        </p>

        <p>
            See the following mock-ups for an idea of what the application should look like.
        </p>

        The grid view:
        <img src="assignment_spec_images/grid_view.png" class="img-responsive">

        The list view:
        <img src="assignment_spec_images/list_view.png" class="img-responsive">

        A responsive view:
        <img src="assignment_spec_images/responsive.png" class="img-responsive">

        <p>
            Users can rate each image by selecting the number of stars to assign to that image. They should
            also be able to filter images with a minimum rating (e.g., 3-star) by clicking on the search filter
            on the top right of the screen, in the toolbar. Note that you will need to determine whether it
            is useful for the user to be able to clear a rating after it is given, and if so, how that should be done.
        </p>

        <p>
            By default, the images should be displayed as smaller thumbnails. Clicking on an image should enlarge
            it. However, it should never be larger than the width of the screen. You should also provide a mechanism
            to return the image to a smaller size. You may choose the means of displaying the larger image, but
            it should be your own code (not code taken from the web).
        </p>

    </div>


    <div>
        <h2>
            Implementation Details and Requirements
        </h2>

        <p>
            <a href="fotag.html">fotag.html</a> is the web page for your application, with
            <a href="js/fotag.js">fotag.js</a> the application's main entry point. <a href="js/model.js">model.js</a>
            should house your models, and <a href="js/view.js">view.js</a> should contain your views.
            You should place all of your CSS in <a href="css/fotag.css">fotag.css</a>. There are a number of examples
            within the provided code for creating widgets, dealing with file selections, and storing and loading
            data. Study these carefully and adapt them to your needs.
        </p>

        <h3>Selecting Images</h3>

        <p>
            We will be using HTML5's new File API to select multiple files
            on the file system. This API provides a file name and modification date for each
            file chosen.
        </p>

        <p>
            You will use <code>img</code> tags to "load" images into the web page.
            The File API does not provide an absolute path to the file, which is problematic, since
            the <code>img</code> tag requires an absolute or relative path to a
            file. Accordingly, we will assume all files that are chosen are chosen from the images/ directory.
            Given this assumption, when a user chooses an image filename.jpg, and you wish to view it, you can construct
            an <code>img</code>
            tag whose src is images/filename.jpg. We have included
            a handful of images in that directory to facilitate testing. Please do not delete these images,
            as they may be used in testing.
        </p>

        <p>
            We have already provided demo code that demonstrates how to select images and place them
            in the models specified below. When a user selects images to view, they should be saved
            via localStorage using the provided code. Furthermore, when reloading the page, the app
            should automatically load the images from localStorage and redisplay them.
        </p>

        <p>
            The File API (theoretically) also allows users to drag and drop files into the browser to select them. See
            <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/">http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/</a>
            for example code. This functionality is not required, but would be useful.
        </p>

        <h3>Responsive Design Breakpoints</h3>

        <p>
            For the purposes of this assignment, a "small" device should be considered any device, display, or window
            whose width is less than 760 pixels. Set your media query breakpoints in CSS accordingly. We will test
            your application to ensure it is responsive when the window size or device size is smaller than 760 pixels.
        </p>

        <h3>Models</h3>

        <p>
            Your implementation must make use of the model-view-controller architecture. Specifically,
            you must implement the following models, stubbed out in <a href="js/model.js">model.js</a>:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>ImageModel</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>ImageCollectionModel</code>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>ImageModel</h4>

        <p>
            The <code>ImageModel</code> represents a single image: the path to the image, its modification date,
            the user rating, and any user-supplied caption. The modification date, user rating, and caption all
            represent its <em>metadata</em>. You do not need to support the ability for users
            to caption images, though that would be a nice, and useful, feature.
        </p>

        <p>
            The ImageModel must implement the Observer pattern, and notify listeners whenever it changes in any way.
            The signature for listeners is specified in the code.
        </p>

        <h4>ImageCollectionModel</h4>

        <p>
            The <code>ImageCollectionModel</code> represents a collection of <code>ImageModel</code> objects. It must
            also
            implement the Observer pattern and notify listeners whenever it, <strong>or any of its
            <code>ImageModel</code> objects</strong>,
            changes in any way. The signature for listeners is specified in the code.

        </p>

        <h3>Views</h3>

        <p>
            You must implement the following views, found in <a href="js/view.js">view.js</a>:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>ImageRenderer</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>ImageRendererFactory</code> (technically, not a view)
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>ImageCollectionView</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>Toolbar</code>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            All of your views should be able to be instantiated multiple times. In other words, they should
            be template-based and not have IDs assigned to their individual elements. You must define
            these views using the <code>template</code> tag in the app's HTML.
        </p>

        <h4>ImageRenderer</h4>

        <p>
            The <code>ImageRenderer</code> is the object responsible for rendering a single <code>ImageModel</code> in
            the web page (where the <code>ImageModel</code> includes both the image and its metadata). It must
            support two modes of rendering its contents, corresponding to either
            list or grid view.
        </p>

        <p>
            The renderer must also be <em>responsive</em> and change its appearance according to
            the width of the display/window it is rendering on. Primarily, this involves changing how metadata is
            rendered to the screen as a function of the available width. At larger widths, the metadata
            should appear to the <em>right</em> of images. For smaller screen/device widths, it should appear
            <em>below</em> the images.
        </p>

        <p>
            To display an image, the <code>ImageRenderer</code> should construct an <code>img</code> tag whose src
            points
            to the path contained within the corresponding <code>ImageModel</code>. The <code>ImageRenderer</code>
            should
            render <em>thumbnails</em> of the images, rather than the images at full size. You should determine
            what an acceptable size is for the thumbnails through user testing.

        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to rendering the associated metadata, the <code>ImageRenderer</code> should also support
            any interaction required. It should also update its view if the underlying
            <code>ImageModel</code> changes in any way. Your view should register with the model as a listener,
            to be informed of any changes.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <code>ImageRenderer</code> has a method, <code>getElement()</code>, which must return
            an element that can be added to the DOM.
        </p>

        <h4>ImageRendererFactory</h4>

        <p>
            A Factory is an object that produces other objects. In this assignment, you will create an
            <code>ImageRendererFactory</code> that will produce new <code>ImageRenderer</code> objects.
            The <code>ImageCollectionView</code> will use whatever <code>ImageRendererFactory</code> object
            is installed in it to create new <code>ImageRenderer</code> objects as needed.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Factory object is not complicated: it just creates new objects that fulfill the
            <code>ImageRenderer</code>
            class's contract. You can think of it as an object constructor, of sorts. For example, to
            create a new <code>ImageRendererFactory</code> that produces the <code>ImageRenderer</code> objects
            described above,
            you would just need a line of code like <code>new ImageRenderer(imageModel)</code> in your code.
        </p>

        <p>
            Factoring the design this way will allow us to substitute different <code>ImageRenderer</code>s
            at runtime, to test your MVC architecture.
        </p>

        <h4>ImageCollectionView</h4>

        <p>
            The <code>ImageCollectionView</code> is the view for <code>ImageCollectionModel</code> objects.
            It is also a collection of <code>ImageRenderer</code> objects.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <code>ImageCollectionView</code> creates new <code>ImageRenderer</code> objects using
            an <code>ImageRendererFactory</code>. By default, it should have an <code>ImageRendererFactory</code>
            installed when it is constructed. This factory can be set at runtime, at which time, the
            view should update to use the new factory (i.e., it should recreate the interface using the new
            factory, whenever a new factory is installed).
        </p>

        <p>
            You <em>may not</em> use a <code>table</code> to implement the <code>ImageCollectionView</code>. Instead,
            you should use floats to lay out your individual <code>ImageRenderer</code> objects.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <code>ImageCollectionView</code> provides methods to change the view type, and should also
            respond to any changes to the underlying <code>ImageCollectionModel</code> (such as images being
            added or removed).
        </p>

        <p>
            The <code>ImageCollectionView</code> has a method, <code>getElement()</code>, which must return
            an element that can be added to the DOM.
        </p>

        <h4>Toolbar</h4>

        <p>
            The <code>Toolbar</code> is a panel that has at least the following buttons:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A list selection button
            </li>
            <li>
                A grid selection button
            </li>
            <li>
                A rating filter
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The list and grid selection buttons allow the user to toggle between list and grid views. The
            rating filter allows the user to select the minimum star rating for displaying images. For example, if the
            user chooses three stars, then all images displayed must have a rating of three or greater.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can think of this Toolbar as both a model and a view. All objects interested in the
            current view type and current filter rating should register with the Toolbar for changes to these settings.
            That is, the Toolbar should be the definitive source for what is the currently selected view
            and current minimum rating level.
        </p>

        <h4>File Selection</h4>
        The designs do not specify how you should allow the user to choose what files to load and display.
        We have included demo code that demonstrates how to get files, but it is up to you to incorporate
        this functionality into the app's design in a way that makes for a good visual design and interactive
        experience.

        <h4>Marking Button and Unit Tests</h4>

        <p>
            You'll note in the HTML that we include a marking button and a link to unit tests. Neither
            of these should be altered or removed. They will allow us to programmatically test and manipulate
            your application for marking purposes.
        </p>

        <h2>Bugs</h2>

        <p>
            As with any software, there are bound to be bugs in the code, and ambiguities in
            the specifications. We will respond to any bugs or questions and offer corrections
            and clarifications as needed.
        </p>

    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>
            Testing
        </h2>

        <p>
            To unit test assignments, we will be using <a href="http://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a>,
            <a href="http://chaijs.com/">Chai</a>, <a href="http://sinonjs.org/">Sinon</a>, and
            <a href="https://github.com/domenic/sinon-chai">Sinon-Chai</a>. All of the components
            necessary to do unit testing are included.
        </p>

        <h3>How to Run the Unit Tests</h3>

        <p>
            When loaded, the <a href="unit_tests.html">unit_tests.html</a> file will execute the unit tests found in
            <a href="js/unit_tests/provided_unit_tests.js">provided_unit_tests.js</a> and
            <a href="js/unit_tests/marking_unit_tests.js">marking_unit_tests.js</a>. There is a link in
            the web app's page to go to this unit test. This link should remain within the code, so TAs can
            easily execute your unit tests.
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>You must create at least 5 unit tests for this assignment that validate your MVC
                architecture</em> (e.g., that you can add listeners, and that they are called at appropriate
            times). Add these unit tests in provided_unit_tests.js, and ensure they execute properly and without error!
        </p>

        <p>
            The marking_unit_tests.js file is empty: Do not add anything to this. It will be overwritten with our own
            unit tests at marking time, to further test your code.
        </p>

        <h3>What We Will Test for Marking</h3>

        <p>
            We will be testing your model-view-controller architecture, and your overall architecture to
            ensure it conforms to the specifications provided. For example, for this assignment, we may
            change the renderer factory at runtime, to change the appearance of the images rendered to the
            screen, we may programmatically alter view and rating selections, we may create multiple
            <code>ImageCollectionView</code>s and place them on the screen, etc. We will do so by
            adding code to markers_code.js, and programmatically creating new views and models.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Assignment Constraints</h3>

        <p>
            You must complete the assignment within the following constraints:
        </p>

        <ul>

            <li>You must use only HTML, JavaScript and CSS that you, yourself, have created.
                <em>You may not use any other third-party JavaScript or CSS files for this assignment, including
                    web frameworks and code generation tools.</em> However, we have included underscore.js.
            </li>

            <li>
                This is a single-page web application: <em>there should be only one web page that the user loads
                and interacts with -- they should never leave it</em> (with the exception of the unit tests).
                <em>We will take off significant marks if you redirect the user to another page.</em>
            </li>

            <li>
                The wireframe designs are meant to be a suggestion for how the interface and interaction could be
                supported. You have latitude to change the design, provided the functionality remains the same,
                and your changes are an improvement to the design provided.
            </li>

            <li>
                All of your JavaScript files should work with (and include) <code>'use strict';</code>.
            </li>

            <li>
                You must use the convention in the code of creating functions that return your classes, to
                create modules.
            </li>

            <li>
                You may not use <code>table</code> elements anywhere in this assignment. All layout must
                be done using floats.
            </li>

            <li>
                You must use the <code>addEventListener()</code> means of responding to events in the browser.
            </li>

            <li>
                You may use <em>code snippets</em> from third-party sources, but no external libraries (HTML, JS,
                or CSS), or external code-generation tools. You must cite the use of any
                third-party code (including a URL if the example was obtained online).
            </li>

            <li>
                Your assignment may not make use of any external files loaded over the Internet. It will be
                tested locally, in offline moded.
            </li>

        <h2>Marking</h2>

        <p>
            To receive a great mark, you must implement the system as described above, under the given constraints,
            with all unit tests passing, while having an aesthetically pleasing design and a great user experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a <em>rough</em> guide, <em>about 25%</em> of your mark will be allocated to the visual design and
            user experience, with the rest allocated to implementation concerns. Note that the implementation
            specifications
            include items related to user experience, such as responsive design and responsive layout. These aspects
            of user experience will be part of the implementation marks.
        </p>

        <p>
            TAs will mark your assignment using the latest version of Chrome on whatever platform
            they use on a daily basis. In theory, the specific platform shouldn't matter. If we
            find platform differences, we'll handle them as they arise. They will mark the assignment
            in "offline" mode (i.e., with no access to the Internet).
        </p>
